Creating an object detection system for butterflies and flowers involves collecting annotated images, training a deep learning model (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO), and validating for accuracy. Preprocessing ensures standardized features. Deployment with a user-friendly interface supports biodiversity monitoring, pest control, and habitat preservation.
